# mostlylikeable-gradle-plugins (WIP)

Just playing around for now to better understand custom gradle plugins written with kotlin.

# testing
Tests might be a bit excessive but that's in large part due to a want to exercise these plugins in other projects and
provide examples of different test types and frameworks.
